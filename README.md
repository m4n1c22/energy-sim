# energy-sim

This is a repository where we have talked about simulating energy schedules for a domestic household setup. 
Simulation is performed on top of Python Flask.

## Requirements

- Python 3 
- Flask
- venv

## Setting up and running the simulation

It is always better to setup a virtual environment before you move on to building simulation on preinstalled python environment. 

- Pull this repo and switch to develop branch.

- Create a new venv if you haven't yet. `python -m venv simenv`

- Configure venv: `source simenv/bin/activate`

- Move to `src/frontend` folder using `cd`.

- Run `python gui.py` to start the flask app.

- Open the browser and type in `localhost:1234` and you will start seeing the simulation taking play.
